Welcome to the Interactive Action Figure Generator!

My name is Macy Roland. I am a Computer Science student at Florida State College of Jacksonville 
        and this is my Intergrated Action Figure Generator!
       
                    As a passionate computer science student with a love for creative technology, I’ve designed a webpage generator that brings quiz results to life in an exciting way!

                    This innovative tool takes user inputs from a personality quiz and creates a fully customized, animated action figure based on the results.

                    Whether it’s a daring adventurer, a tech-savvy hero, or an artistic visionary, each figure is tailored to reflect the user’s unique traits.
